## üîß Overview

We propose two multidomain-adaptive modules for semantic image communication over wireless channels:

- **MASCN (Multidomain Adaptive Semantic Coding Network)**  
  A StarGAN-based end-to-end encoder-decoder architecture that inherently supports multi-domain semantic encoding and decoding, making it robust against both domain shifts and channel noise (e.g., AWGN, Fading).

- **MDAN (Multidomain Data Adaptation Network)**  
  A generalized, StarGAN-based adaptation module derived from the CycleGAN-like framework in [4], enabling multi domain data adaptation to desired target domains, prior to semantic endcoding.

Both components support **multi-domain settings in a unified and scalable manner**, and can be combined or used independently.
